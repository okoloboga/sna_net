analyze-menu = 📊 Ask the neural network to analyze your dreams!

               It will use your last 3 or 7 dream entries for the analysis. 
               If any of them contain sleepy mumblings from voice messages, I recommend editing them into a readable form 😊

               If this is your first time doing this, I suggest filling out your 🙋‍♂️ Self-Description. 
               The neural network doesn’t know the context of your 🌟 dreams — so it needs some help! 
               Tell it about the active 🧸 characters in your dreams, places, and events, 
               so it understands who’s who.
